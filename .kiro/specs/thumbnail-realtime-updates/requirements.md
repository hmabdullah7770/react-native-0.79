# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature fixes the thumbnail UI synchronization issue where thumbnail changes (add/remove) don't immediately reflect in the ThumbnailBottomnav dropdown. Users currently need to close and reopen the modal to see the updated thumbnail state.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see thumbnail changes immediately in the dropdown, so that I have real-time feedback when adding or removing thumbnails.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload a new thumbnail THEN the dropdown SHALL immediately show the new thumbnail state without requiring modal closure
2. WHEN I remove a thumbnail THEN the dropdown SHALL immediately update to show the removed state without requiring modal closure
3. WHEN thumbnail state changes THEN all related UI elements SHALL update synchronously

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the modal content to refresh automatically when I make changes, so that I don't need to manually close and reopen it to see updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN thumbnail state changes THEN the modal items array SHALL regenerate automatically
2. WHEN the items array updates THEN the ThumbnailBottomnav SHALL re-render immediately
3. WHEN state updates occur THEN the modal height SHALL adjust appropriately if needed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent UI behavior across all thumbnail operations, so that the interface feels responsive and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any thumbnail operation completes THEN the UI SHALL reflect the change within 100ms
2. WHEN multiple rapid changes occur THEN the UI SHALL handle them gracefully without flickering
3. WHEN state updates fail THEN the UI SHALL maintain consistency and show appropriate feedback
