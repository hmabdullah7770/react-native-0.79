# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the requirements for optimizing UI performance in the ecommerceverse React Native application, specifically focusing on replacing ScrollView components with FlashList for better performance when rendering large lists of media items and layout options in the CreatePost feature.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user creating posts with multiple media items, I want the media grid to scroll smoothly without performance issues, so that I can efficiently manage and organize my content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads more than 10 media items THEN the media grid SHALL render smoothly without lag or stuttering
2. WHEN a user scrolls through the media carousel layout THEN the scrolling SHALL be performant and responsive
3. WHEN the media grid is displayed THEN memory usage SHALL be optimized through efficient list rendering
4. WHEN media items are added or removed THEN the list SHALL update without performance degradation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user selecting layout options, I want the layout selection to be responsive, so that I can quickly choose the desired layout without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls through layout options THEN the horizontal scrolling SHALL be smooth and responsive
2. WHEN layout options are rendered THEN only visible items SHALL be rendered to optimize performance
3. WHEN a user selects a layout option THEN the selection SHALL respond immediately without delay
4. WHEN the layout options list is displayed THEN it SHALL maintain consistent performance regardless of the number of options

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want to use modern performant list components, so that the application scales well with increased usage and content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing list rendering THEN FlashList SHALL be used instead of ScrollView for better performance
2. WHEN FlashList is implemented THEN it SHALL maintain all existing functionality of the ScrollView
3. WHEN FlashList is integrated THEN proper error handling SHALL be implemented for edge cases
4. WHEN the component renders THEN it SHALL be backwards compatible with existing props and behavior
5. WHEN FlashList is used THEN proper item sizing and layout SHALL be maintained for all layout types

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user with a lower-end device, I want the CreatePost interface to remain responsive, so that I can create posts without experiencing app crashes or freezing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the CreatePost feature on lower-end devices THEN the interface SHALL remain responsive
2. WHEN large numbers of media items are loaded THEN memory usage SHALL be optimized to prevent crashes
3. WHEN scrolling through content THEN frame rates SHALL remain consistent across different device specifications
4. WHEN the component unmounts THEN memory SHALL be properly cleaned up to prevent memory leaks
