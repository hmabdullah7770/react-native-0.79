# Layout-First Media Upload Workflow Requirements

## Introduction

This feature addresses a critical workflow issue in the InlineImageGrid component where users can upload media in one layout and then switch to incompatible layouts, creating confusion and validation errors. The solution enforces a "layout-first" workflow where users must select their desired layout before uploading media, and layout options become locked once media is uploaded.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Layout Selection Before Upload

**User Story:** As a user, I want to choose my layout style before uploading media, so that I can upload the correct number of items for my chosen layout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no media is uploaded THEN all layout options SHALL be available for selection
2. WHEN a layout is selected AND no media exists THEN the layout description SHALL show the required number of items (e.g., "Single item only", "4 slots", "3 slots")
3. WHEN a user selects a layout THEN the upload placeholder SHALL indicate the layout requirements (e.g., "Upload 1 photo/video for Single layout")
4. WHEN a layout with specific requirements is selected THEN helper text SHALL guide the user on how many items to upload

### Requirement 2: Layout Locking After Upload

**User Story:** As a user who has uploaded media, I want the layout options to be locked to prevent conflicts, so that I don't accidentally create invalid layout-media combinations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN media is uploaded THEN layout options SHALL be hidden or disabled
2. WHEN media exists AND user wants to change layout THEN they SHALL be required to remove all media first
3. WHEN all media is removed THEN layout options SHALL become available again
4. WHEN layout is locked THEN a message SHALL indicate "Remove all media to change layout" or similar

### Requirement 3: Layout-Specific Upload Constraints

**User Story:** As a user, I want the upload functionality to respect my chosen layout's constraints, so that I can only upload the appropriate number of items.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN layout "1" is selected THEN upload SHALL accept maximum 1 item
2. WHEN layout "2" is selected THEN upload SHALL accept unlimited items (up to system limit of 10)
3. WHEN layout "2x2" is selected THEN upload SHALL accept exactly 4 items
4. WHEN layout "1x2" is selected THEN upload SHALL accept exactly 3 items
5. WHEN layout "1x3" is selected THEN upload SHALL accept exactly 4 items
6. WHEN layout "carousel" is selected THEN upload SHALL accept minimum 2 items (up to system limit of 10)
7. WHEN maximum items for a layout is reached THEN upload options SHALL be disabled

### Requirement 4: Clear Layout Communication

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear information about each layout's requirements, so that I can make an informed choice before uploading.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing layout options THEN each option SHALL show its item requirements clearly
2. WHEN layout "1" is shown THEN it SHALL indicate "Single item only"
3. WHEN layout "2" is shown THEN it SHALL indicate "2+ items"
4. WHEN layout "2x2" is shown THEN it SHALL indicate "Exactly 4 items"
5. WHEN layout "1x2" is shown THEN it SHALL indicate "Exactly 3 items"
6. WHEN layout "1x3" is shown THEN it SHALL indicate "Exactly 4 items"
7. WHEN layout "carousel" is shown THEN it SHALL indicate "2+ items"

### Requirement 5: Workflow Reset Functionality

**User Story:** As a user who wants to change layouts after uploading, I want a clear way to reset and start over, so that I can choose a different layout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN media is uploaded AND layout is locked THEN a "Change Layout" or "Start Over" button SHALL be provided
2. WHEN "Change Layout" is clicked THEN a confirmation dialog SHALL ask "Remove all media to change layout?"
3. WHEN user confirms layout change THEN all media SHALL be removed AND layout options SHALL become available
4. WHEN user cancels layout change THEN current media and layout SHALL remain unchanged
5. WHEN layout is reset THEN the interface SHALL return to the initial state with all layout options available

### Requirement 6: Progressive Upload Guidance

**User Story:** As a user uploading media for a specific layout, I want guidance on how many more items I need, so that I can complete the layout requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading for layouts with minimum requirements THEN progress SHALL be shown (e.g., "2 of 4 items uploaded")
2. WHEN minimum requirements are not met THEN a message SHALL indicate how many more items are needed
3. WHEN exact requirements exist (like 2x2) THEN the interface SHALL show all required slots, filled and empty
4. WHEN maximum is reached THEN upload options SHALL be disabled with a "Layout complete" message
5. WHEN uploading for flexible layouts (like "2" or "carousel") THEN "Add More" options SHALL remain available until system limit

### Requirement 7: Layout Validation Prevention

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to prevent layout-media mismatches, so that I never encounter validation errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a layout is selected THEN only compatible upload actions SHALL be available
2. WHEN switching layouts is attempted with existing media THEN the action SHALL be blocked with clear explanation
3. WHEN media count doesn't match layout requirements THEN layout switching SHALL be prevented
4. WHEN all constraints are met THEN no validation errors SHALL occur
5. WHEN layout requirements are satisfied THEN a success indicator SHALL be shown
