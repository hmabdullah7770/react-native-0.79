# Dynamic Media Grid Layout Requirements

## Introduction

This feature addresses the issue where the InlineImageGrid component doesn't properly render uploaded media according to the selected layout option. Currently, when users select different layouts (1x2, 2x2, carousel, etc.), the media grid shows placeholder blue boxes instead of arranging the actual uploaded images in the correct layout structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Dynamic Layout Rendering

**User Story:** As a user uploading media, I want the grid to immediately reflect my selected layout so that I can see how my images will be arranged.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a layout option THEN the media grid SHALL immediately rearrange uploaded images according to the selected layout
2. WHEN a user has uploaded images and changes layout THEN the existing images SHALL be repositioned to match the new layout structure
3. WHEN a layout requires specific positioning (like 1x2 with one large image and two smaller ones) THEN the images SHALL be sized and positioned correctly
4. WHEN a user selects a layout that requires more images than currently uploaded THEN the system SHALL show placeholder areas for missing images

### Requirement 2: Layout-Specific Image Sizing

**User Story:** As a user, I want images to be properly sized according to the layout so that the preview matches the final result.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN layout is "1" THEN images SHALL display at full width (100%)
2. WHEN layout is "2" THEN images SHALL display in two equal columns (48% width each)
3. WHEN layout is "2x2" THEN images SHALL display in a 2x2 grid with equal sizing
4. WHEN layout is "1x2" THEN the first image SHALL be larger (62% width) and subsequent images SHALL be smaller (35% width)
5. WHEN layout is "1x3" THEN the first image SHALL be larger (62% width) and subsequent images SHALL be smaller (35% width)
6. WHEN layout is "carousel" THEN images SHALL display horizontally with fixed width (200px)

### Requirement 3: Real-time Layout Preview

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a real-time preview of how my images will look in the selected layout.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user changes layout options THEN the media grid SHALL update immediately without requiring re-upload
2. WHEN insufficient images are uploaded for a layout THEN placeholder areas SHALL be shown with "+" icons
3. WHEN too many images are uploaded for a fixed layout THEN excess images SHALL be handled gracefully
4. WHEN layout validation fails THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 4: Layout Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want the layout preview to match exactly how the final post will appear.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN images are arranged in the grid THEN they SHALL maintain aspect ratios appropriately
2. WHEN special layouts (1x2, 1x3) are used THEN the main image SHALL be prominently displayed
3. WHEN carousel layout is selected THEN images SHALL be scrollable horizontally
4. WHEN layout options are displayed THEN they SHALL accurately represent the actual grid structure

### Requirement 5: Responsive Layout Behavior

**User Story:** As a user, I want the layout to work consistently across different screen sizes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing on different screen sizes THEN layouts SHALL maintain their proportional relationships
2. WHEN images are too large for the container THEN they SHALL be scaled appropriately
3. WHEN spacing is applied THEN it SHALL be consistent across all layout types
4. WHEN margins and padding are applied THEN they SHALL not break the layout structure
