# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical UI responsiveness issues in the bottom navigation components of the CreatePost feature. Users are experiencing problems with TextInput placeholders not opening keyboards consistently, Switch components not responding properly, and FlatList components not scrolling correctly. These issues significantly impact user experience and need to be resolved to ensure smooth interaction with the bottom navigation modals.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user entering URLs in bottom navigation modals, I want the keyboard to open consistently when I tap on TextInput fields, so that I can enter text without having to tap multiple times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user taps on a TextInput placeholder in StoreBottomnav THEN the keyboard SHALL open immediately on first tap
2. WHEN a user closes the keyboard and taps the TextInput again THEN the keyboard SHALL open immediately on subsequent taps
3. WHEN a user taps on a TextInput placeholder in ProductBottomnav THEN the keyboard SHALL open consistently every time
4. WHEN the TextInput is disabled (store mode) THEN it SHALL clearly indicate its disabled state and not attempt to open keyboard
5. WHEN switching between URL and store/product modes THEN TextInput focus behavior SHALL work correctly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user configuring social media links, I want the Switch components to respond immediately when tapped, so that I can enable/disable social media platforms without delays or multiple taps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user taps the Facebook switch THEN it SHALL toggle immediately and show appropriate feedback
2. WHEN a user taps the WhatsApp switch THEN it SHALL toggle immediately and show appropriate feedback  
3. WHEN a user taps the Instagram switch THEN it SHALL toggle immediately and show appropriate feedback
4. WHEN a user taps the Store Link switch THEN it SHALL toggle immediately and show appropriate feedback
5. WHEN a switch is disabled due to missing AsyncStorage values THEN it SHALL show proper alert and not change state
6. WHEN AsyncStorage values are present THEN switches SHALL enable/disable correctly without delays

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user selecting categories, I want the horizontal FlatList to scroll smoothly, so that I can browse through all available categories without the interface becoming stuck.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user scrolls the category FlatList horizontally THEN it SHALL scroll smoothly without getting stuck
2. WHEN a user taps on category items THEN they SHALL respond immediately to touch events
3. WHEN the FlatList is rendered THEN it SHALL properly handle touch events and not block interactions
4. WHEN categories are loading THEN the loading state SHALL not interfere with touch responsiveness
5. WHEN the modal is opened THEN the FlatList SHALL be immediately scrollable without requiring multiple touches

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user interacting with bottom navigation modals, I want all touch interactions to be responsive and immediate, so that I can complete my tasks efficiently without interface delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any bottom navigation modal is opened THEN all interactive elements SHALL respond to touch immediately
2. WHEN keyboard appears THEN the modal SHALL adjust properly without breaking touch responsiveness
3. WHEN modal animations are running THEN touch events SHALL still be processed correctly
4. WHEN multiple modals are used in sequence THEN each SHALL maintain full responsiveness
5. WHEN the device is under load THEN touch responsiveness SHALL remain consistent

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want to understand the root causes of UI responsiveness issues, so that similar problems can be prevented in future components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing bottom sheet components THEN proper touch event handling patterns SHALL be documented
2. WHEN using Animated.View components THEN touch event propagation SHALL be properly configured
3. WHEN implementing keyboard handling THEN proper focus management SHALL be implemented
4. WHEN using third-party libraries THEN they SHALL be configured for optimal touch responsiveness
5. WHEN debugging touch issues THEN proper logging and debugging tools SHALL be available
