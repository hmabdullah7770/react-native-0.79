# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ThumbnailBottomnav component is not displaying properly when users attempt to upload video thumbnails. When users click "add thumbnail" or access video settings, the screen dims (indicating the modal overlay is active) but the bottom navigation panel itself is not visible, making it impossible for users to upload thumbnails or modify video settings.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user uploading videos, I want to see the thumbnail settings bottom navigation panel when I click on video settings, so that I can upload custom thumbnails and configure video options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a video in the media grid THEN the ThumbnailBottomnav SHALL appear from the bottom of the screen with proper animation
2. WHEN the ThumbnailBottomnav is visible THEN it SHALL display above all other UI elements with correct z-index positioning
3. WHEN the ThumbnailBottomnav appears THEN it SHALL have the correct height and positioning to be fully visible on screen
4. WHEN the backdrop overlay is active THEN the ThumbnailBottomnav SHALL still be visible and interactive

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the thumbnail upload interface to be properly sized and positioned, so that I can easily access all video settings options without UI obstruction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ThumbnailBottomnav is displayed THEN it SHALL have a minimum height that accommodates all content without scrolling
2. WHEN the component renders THEN it SHALL position itself correctly at the bottom of the screen regardless of device size
3. WHEN multiple video settings options are present THEN the component SHALL expand its height dynamically to fit all content
4. WHEN the component is too tall for the screen THEN it SHALL provide internal scrolling while maintaining visibility

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want consistent visual feedback when interacting with video settings, so that I understand when the interface is loading or responding to my actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ThumbnailBottomnav is opening THEN it SHALL animate smoothly from bottom to visible position
2. WHEN the ThumbnailBottomnav is closing THEN it SHALL animate smoothly from visible position to bottom
3. WHEN the backdrop is active THEN it SHALL have proper opacity and not interfere with the bottom navigation visibility
4. WHEN the component is fully loaded THEN all interactive elements SHALL be immediately accessible

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper z-index and positioning management, so that the ThumbnailBottomnav displays correctly across different screen sizes and orientations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ThumbnailBottomnav is rendered THEN it SHALL have a z-index higher than the backdrop overlay
2. WHEN the component is positioned THEN it SHALL account for safe area insets on devices with notches or home indicators
3. WHEN the screen orientation changes THEN the component SHALL maintain proper positioning and visibility
4. WHEN multiple modals are present THEN the ThumbnailBottomnav SHALL have appropriate stacking order
