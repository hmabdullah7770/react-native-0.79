**Feature Branch**: `001-feature-audio-recorder`
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Audio recorder using react-native-audio-api in RecorderBottomnav component"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure) ‚Äî exceptions: implementation notes for mobile native capabilities allowed where necessary
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user creating a post, I want to record a short audio clip directly from the Create Post flow so I can attach it to my post, preview it, and choose to use or discard it before publishing.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the Create Post screen is open, **When** the user opens the audio recorder, **Then** they can start and stop recording and see an updating timer and pulsing recording indicator.
2. **Given** a recording has been made, **When** the user plays the recording, **Then** playback starts and a playback timer and progress bar update until completion.
3. **Given** a recording has been made, **When** the user chooses "Use Audio", **Then** the audio file is attached to the post payload and recorder UI closes.
4. **Given** a recording has been made, **When** the user deletes the recording, **Then** the recorded audio is removed and recorder UI resets to the initial state.
5. **Given** microphone permission is denied, **When** the user attempts to record, **Then** the app shows a clear permission error and guidance to enable microphone access.

### Edge Cases
- Recording longer than expected (duration limit): recorder should either stop automatically at a configurable max duration or indicate the cap to the user.
- Interrupted recording due to incoming call or app backgrounding: recording should stop and either save a partial clip or discard based on UX decision (marked for clarification).
- Insufficient storage to save recording: show error and guidance.
- Corrupted recorded file or playback failure: show error and allow retry/delete.


## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The UI MUST allow users to open an audio recorder modal from the Create Post screen.
- **FR-002**: The recorder MUST request microphone permission and handle denied/granted states with clear user feedback.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to start and stop recording. The UI MUST display a live recording timer and pulsing visual indicator while recording.
- **FR-004**: After stopping, users MUST be able to play/pause the recorded audio and see playback time and progress.
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to delete the recorded audio, which returns the recorder to the initial state.
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to confirm and attach the recorded audio to the post payload.
- **FR-007**: The recorder MUST enforce a configurable maximum recording duration (or explicitly document that none is enforced). [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: desired default max duration?]
- **FR-008**: The system MUST handle failure modes gracefully: permission denied, storage failure, recording interruptions, and playback errors.
- **FR-009**: Recorded audio file metadata (duration, size, URI) MUST be made available to the Create Post screen when user confirms.

*Marked assumptions*:
- The feature will use the mobile device microphone and store recordings temporarily in app storage until attached or discarded.

### Key Entities
- **Recording**: Represents a captured audio clip. Key attributes: uri (string), duration (number, seconds), size (number, bytes), mimeType (string), createdAt (timestamp).

## Implementation Notes (developer-facing - optional)
These notes call out mobile platform considerations and suggested integration approach. Keep this section short; keep the core spec platform-agnostic.
- Use a native-capable audio recording library that supports microphone permissions, start/stop recording, file storage, and playback controls. Examples: react-native-audio-api (preferred per request), react-native-audio, expo-av (if using Expo).
- Store temporary recordings in app-specific cache or files directory until user confirms.
- Implement clear permission request flows per platform (Android: RECORD_AUDIO + runtime permission; iOS: NSMicrophoneUsageDescription) and graceful fallbacks.
- Consider background/interrupt handling: decide whether to auto-save partial recordings or discard on interruptions.
