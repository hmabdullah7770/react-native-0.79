# Feature Specification: Investigate 500 when fetching store products

**Feature Branch**: `007-title-investigate-500`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "{\"title\":\"Investigate 500 when fetching store products\",\"description\":\"Investigate and fix the 500 error seen when fetching store products via GET_STORE_PRODUCT_REQUEST from the app. Include reproduction steps, likely causes in client and server, suggested fixes, and code changes to add better error logging and resilience in sagas and actions.\"}"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
	→ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
	→ Identify: actors (mobile app, store owner), actions (fetch store products), data (storeId, products), constraints (backend returns 500)
3. For each unclear aspect:
	→ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
5. Generate Functional Requirements
6. Identify Key Entities
7. Run Review Checklist
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for implementation planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT needs to be done and WHY (investigate 500 error and improve robustness)
- ❌ Avoid deep implementation plan in this doc; highlight what to change and where

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Key Entities, Review & Acceptance

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a store owner using the mobile app, when I open the product picker or product manager, the app should fetch my store's products and display them. Instead, the app sometimes receives a 500 error from the backend and shows an empty list or an error message.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. Given a valid store owner with storeId present in Keychain, When the app dispatches GET_STORE_PRODUCT_REQUEST with that storeId, Then the saga should call the API and populate the product list on success (status 200) and surface an actionable error on failure.
2. Given the server returns 500, When the app receives that response, Then the saga should log the full error (status, response body, request path and params) and dispatch GET_STORE_PRODUCT_FAIL with a user-friendly, non-sensitive error message while preserving diagnostic info in logs.
3. Given a malformed or missing storeId, When GET_STORE_PRODUCT_REQUEST is dispatched, Then the client should validate inputs, avoid making an invalid API call, and dispatch GET_STORE_PRODUCT_FAIL with a validation error.

### Edge Cases
- storeId is null/undefined/empty string
- network timeouts or connectivity issues
- backend returns non-JSON body or unexpected response structure
- large product lists (pagination or performance considerations)
- partial product objects (missing productImages or productPrice fields)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- FR-001: The client MUST validate `storeId` before calling API. If invalid, abort and dispatch a clear error.
- FR-002: The saga handling GET_STORE_PRODUCT_REQUEST MUST catch and categorize errors: 4xx client errors, 5xx server errors, network errors, and unexpected response formats.
- FR-003: On HTTP 500 (or other 5xx), the client MUST dispatch GET_STORE_PRODUCT_FAIL with a user-facing message and include diagnostic details in the action payload (for dev mode only) or in a separate logging channel.
- FR-004: The client MUST log request URL, method, storeId, response status, and any backend error message to help debugging (ensure no sensitive tokens are logged).
- FR-005: The client MUST support a retry/backoff strategy for transient errors (optional initial retry: 1 retry with small delay).
- FR-006: The reducer MUST handle fail/success cases idempotently and avoid duplicating products when multiple requests are initiated concurrently.

### Non-functional Requirements
- NFR-001: Logging should be verbose in development mode and minimal in production.
- NFR-002: Error messages shown to users should be generic ("Something went wrong while loading products. Please try again.") while developers can access detailed logs.

### Implementation Notes (high-level)
- Add input validation in the action creator or saga before calling the API.
- Enhance the saga (`GetStoreProductSaga`) to:
  - Validate payload.storeId
  - Surround API call with robust try/catch and inspect Axios error object to extract response/status/data
  - On error, create structured diagnostic object and include it in dev-only action payload or send to remote logging (Reactotron / Sentry)
  - Optionally implement a single retry for network/5xx errors
- Update reducer to ensure it replaces product lists on success (no appends unless intentionally paginated) and guard against duplicates.

## Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- StoreId (string): unique identifier for the store, required to fetch products
- Product (object): expected fields: _id, productName, productImages (array), productPrice, finalPrice (optional)

## Review & Acceptance Checklist

### Content Quality
- [x] No implementation heavy details
- [x] Focused on user value and debugging the error
- [x] Mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness
- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous

## Execution Status
- [x] User description parsed
- [x] Key concepts extracted
- [x] Ambiguities marked: none critical, but server-side logs will be required
- [x] User scenarios defined
- [x] Requirements generated
- [x] Entities identified
- [x] Review checklist passed (draft)

### Next steps (recommended)
1. Implement input validation for `storeId` in `getStoreProductRequest` or `GetStoreProductSaga`.
2. Improve error handling in `GetStoreProductSaga` to log Axios error details (status, response.data) and dispatch more informative failure actions for dev mode.
3. Add optional retry logic for transient 5xx errors.
4. Add unit tests for saga error handling and reducer idempotency.
5. If server 500s continue, add server-side instrumentation and share sample failing request/response payloads with backend team.
